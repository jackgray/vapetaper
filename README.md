## Approach

The only tools that exist to monitor your use of bad habits are too inconvenient to be effective. PuffCounter requires you pull out the app every time you take a puff, which could be hundreds of times per day. Users rarely have "sessions" like cigarette smokers, due to the convenience and modularity of a vape, there is no commitment to several hits as there is no risk of wasting any. 

It's also highly impractical for most users to log how many puffs they had at the end of a day, due to the high but itermittent frequency of use and reflexive and compulsatory nature of the habit. 

The most accurate metric is your purchase records, and the time between purchases, which often coincide with completed use of a device. 

## Intention

This app aims to make logging your use convenient enough to actually keep up with, and generates rolling average use statistics over varying periods of time so that you can visualize changes in your use patterns.

This app can be utilized for several habits you may want to curb, such as alcohol, cigarettes, and other drugs.

It can show you how much money you have spent, and will even remove the logging requirement entirely if you connect your bank account so that the app can extract purchases from your transaction history.
